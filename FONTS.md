## History

### PostScript Type 1
Adobe released the PostScript language in 1984 as a tool for translating digital documents into print.[3]
PostScript is a high-level language which describes documents as scripts.[1] 
These scripts are read by device-specific PostScript interpretters which produce device-appropriate raster data.

PostScript Type 1 "font programs" were created by Adobe to represent letter and symbol shapes.[2] 
This font format was effectively a modified version of PostScript and also revolved around the execution of descriptive scripts.

### Compact Font Format (CFF)
The CFF format was introduced by Adobe to allow a single file to include multiple PostScript fonts in a "FontSet".[5]

### TrueType
Apple released the TrueType font format in 1991.[0]

### SFNT
The original table-based structure of the TrueType font format was eventually exapted to support other file formats such as PostScript Type 1 and platforms such as Windows. This extended use led to the adoption of a more general term for the format, SFNT (spline font).[0]

### OpenType
OpenType is an extension of the TrueType format.[4]

### WOFF

### WOFF2
