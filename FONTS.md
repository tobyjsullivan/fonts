## History

Adobe released PostScript in 1984 as a tool for translating digital documents into print.[3]

PostScript Type 1 "font programs" were created by Adobe to represent letter and symbol shapes.[2] 
This font format was distinct from the font programs documented in the PostScript Language Reference, known as Type 3.

The SFNT font format was introduced by Apple to be compatible with existing TrueType and PostScript Type 1 font formats.[0]
